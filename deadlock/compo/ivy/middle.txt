    The inductive invariant consists of the following conjectures:
        middle.ivy: line 139: invar2
        middle.ivy: line 140: invar3
        middle.ivy: line 141: invar4

    The following action implementations are present:
        middle.ivy: line 52: implementation of node.route

    The following initializers are present:
        middle.ivy: line 20: spec.init[after1]

    Initialization must establish the invariant
        middle.ivy: line 139: invar2 ... PASS
        middle.ivy: line 140: invar3 ... PASS
        middle.ivy: line 141: invar4 ... PASS

    Any assertions in initializers must be checked ... PASS

    The following set of external actions must preserve the invariant:
        (internal) ext:node.route
            middle.ivy: line 139: invar2 ... PASS
            middle.ivy: line 140: invar3 ... PASS
            middle.ivy: line 141: invar4 ... PASS

OK
