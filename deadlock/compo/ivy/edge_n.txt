    The inductive invariant consists of the following conjectures:
        edge_n.ivy: line 138: invar2
        edge_n.ivy: line 139: invar3
        edge_n.ivy: line 140: invar4
        edge_n.ivy: line 141: invar5

    The following action implementations are present:
        edge_n.ivy: line 52: implementation of node.route

    The following initializers are present:
        edge_n.ivy: line 20: spec.init[after1]

    Initialization must establish the invariant
        edge_n.ivy: line 138: invar2 ... PASS
        edge_n.ivy: line 139: invar3 ... PASS
        edge_n.ivy: line 140: invar4 ... PASS
        edge_n.ivy: line 141: invar5 ... PASS

    Any assertions in initializers must be checked ... PASS

    The following set of external actions must preserve the invariant:
        (internal) ext:node.route
            edge_n.ivy: line 138: invar2 ... PASS
            edge_n.ivy: line 139: invar3 ... PASS
            edge_n.ivy: line 140: invar4 ... PASS
            edge_n.ivy: line 141: invar5 ... PASS

OK
