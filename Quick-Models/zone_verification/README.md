# Zone Verification

These are the final results we present in our paper. To recreate these results, simply run `python3 main.py` from this directory and enter your desired version when prompted. To save time, we recommend choosing “n” when asked if you’d like to do dropped flit testing.



This model is designed to do most of the work behind-the-scenes.

The tests that run appear in a labeled, timestamped folder.
