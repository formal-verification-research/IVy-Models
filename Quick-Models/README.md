# Quick Model Instructions

These models are a subset of our original models. They are the models that can be verified quickly and with little computing power. 

Each folder contains instructions for executing files in its `README.md` file.

## simulation

This folder includes a sample of the C++ model we used for simulation as well as the IVy model we use for livelock verification.

*This work is described in Section 5 of our paper*

## zone_abstraction

This folder includes the model used to produce abstract zones with the help of IVy.

*This work is described in Section 8 of our paper*

## zone_verification

This folder contains a subset of the models used to verify the abstract zone-based model.

*This work is described in Sections 8-10 of our paper*
