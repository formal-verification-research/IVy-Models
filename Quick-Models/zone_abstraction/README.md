# Zone Abstraction

To develop the same zones that we developed, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the folder of the dimension youâ€™d like to check.
2. Run `ivy_check trace=true file.ivy`
3. IVy will return either a trace with a pass, or a trace that indicates that two zones are identical.

The original files and their traces are included in each folder, with invariants previously generated by a script. It is possible to follow our exact procedure as we abstracted the zones by analyzing the traces IVy produces incrementally.
