This is an attempt at making an IVy model of the Network on Chip structure with the intention of allowing for easy scalability.

One of the main goals was attempting to find a way to set up an arbitrarily sized N by N grid in IVy without having to hard-code every connection point.

This model may need some refinement to fully function as intended.  This model used an arbitrary non-deterministic method of routing with the intent that later models will be able to add in a functional routing protocol.
