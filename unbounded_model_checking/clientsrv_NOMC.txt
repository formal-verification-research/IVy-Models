    The inductive invariant consists of the following conjectures:
        clientsrv_mc.ivy: line 27: invar2

    The following action implementations are present:
        clientsrv_mc.ivy: line 14: implementation of connect
        clientsrv_mc.ivy: line 21: implementation of disconnect

    The following initializers are present:
        clientsrv_mc.ivy: line 9: init[after1]

    Initialization must establish the invariant
        clientsrv_mc.ivy: line 27: invar2 ... PASS

    Any assertions in initializers must be checked ... PASS

    The following set of external actions must preserve the invariant:
        (internal) ext:connect
            clientsrv_mc.ivy: line 27: invar2 ... FAIL
