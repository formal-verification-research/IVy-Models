    The inductive invariant consists of the following conjectures:
        idea0_3.ivy: line 61: invar2
        idea0_3.ivy: line 62: invar3

    The following action implementations are present:
        idea0_3.ivy: line 49: implementation of flit.testThing
        idea0_3.ivy: line 29: implementation of router.routeWherever

    The following initializers are present:
        idea0_3.ivy: line 15: spec.init[after1]

    Initialization must establish the invariant
        idea0_3.ivy: line 61: invar2 ... PASS
        idea0_3.ivy: line 62: invar3 ... PASS

    Any assertions in initializers must be checked ... PASS

    The following set of external actions must preserve the invariant:
        (internal) ext:flit.testThing
            idea0_3.ivy: line 61: invar2 ... PASS
            idea0_3.ivy: line 62: invar3 ... FAIL
