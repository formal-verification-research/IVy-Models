# Zone-Based Verification Scripts

The following are present in this directory.

## Counter Models
An attempt has been made to create a counter. Because of the nature of this unbounded model, counting moves has taken a large amount of time. One promising result of this model, however, is that when we check for 20 moves, it takes so long to create a counterexample that it can be inferred that nearly no packet takes longer than 20 moves to reach a destination.

## Verification Models
These models are tests for livelock freedom. See the readme file in this directory for execution instructions.
